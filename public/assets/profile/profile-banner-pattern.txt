## Gemini/AI Art Prompt

```
Create a horizontal banner background pattern for a ninja-themed profile page.

**Art Style:**
- Dark Sumi-e ink wash painting technique
- Extremely subtle and atmospheric
- Misty, ethereal quality
- Minimalist approach - mostly empty space
- Black and dark grey gradients
- Very faint ink washes suggesting depth

**Composition:**
- Horizontal format: 1200x300 pixels
- Tileable horizontally (seamless edges)
- Suggestion of bamboo stalks or trees in silhouette (very faint, 10-20% opacity)
- Wisps of mist or fog using diluted ink effects
- Maybe a distant mountain range silhouette at the horizon line
- Predominantly dark with subtle tonal variations

**Visual Elements:**
- Ink wash clouds or mist (very transparent)
- Faint vertical elements (bamboo, trees) at edges
- Horizontal gradient from darker bottom to slightly lighter top
- Texture suggesting rice paper or canvas
- NO bright colors, NO sharp details, NO busy patterns

**Mood:**
- Contemplative, serene
- Mysterious depth
- Traditional Japanese landscape atmosphere
- Empty but intentional (wabi-sabi aesthetic)

**Negative Prompt:**
photorealistic, 3D render, bright colors, detailed elements, busy pattern, modern design, geometric shapes, vibrant, high contrast
```

## Usage
- Top banner section of profile page
- Behind profile avatar and username
- Creates atmospheric depth without competing with UI elements
- Should be dark enough that white/parchment text is easily readable

## Color Palette
- Base: ink-950 (#050505) to ink-900 (#0d0d0d)
- Mist: ink-700 (#1e1e1e) at 15% opacity
- Subtle highlights: ink-600 (#2a2a2a) at 20% opacity
- Should blend seamlessly with ink-950 background
