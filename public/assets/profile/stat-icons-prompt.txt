## Usage Notes

- All icons should maintain visual consistency as a set
- Should be recognizable even at 32x32 size
- Must work on both dark backgrounds (ink-950) and lighter panels (ink-800)
- Can be used with or without text labels
- Should feel "hand-painted" but still clean and professional

## Design Principles

1. **Silhouette First**: Icon should be recognizable by shape alone
2. **Minimal Strokes**: Each icon uses 1-3 major brushstrokes
3. **Cultural Consistency**: All icons reference Japanese visual language
4. **Functional Clarity**: Purpose must be immediately obvious
5. **Aesthetic Cohesion**: Works together as unified set

## Color Palette

- Primary: ink-950 (#050505) - main icon color
- Secondary: ink-700 (#1e1e1e) - secondary elements/shadows
- Accent: hanko-500 (#cd3838) - only for danger/warning icon
- Background: Transparent (for flexible use)
